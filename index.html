            <ul>
              <li type="none">&#10148;  &nbsp;&nbsp;Professional ethics refers to the set of moral principles and values that guide the behavior and decision-making of individuals in a particular profession. It involves a code of conduct that outlines the responsibilities, obligations, and expectations of professionals towards their clients, colleagues, and society.
</li>
              <li type="none">&#10148;  &nbsp;&nbsp;
Professional ethics help to maintain integrity and trust in a profession and ensure that professionals are held accountable for their actions. They provide a framework for ethical decision-making in complex situations, and help professionals to balance their personal interests with the interests of their clients and society.
</li>
              <li type="none">&#10148;  &nbsp;&nbsp;
Professional ethics vary across different professions, but they all share common values such as honesty, integrity, objectivity, and respect for others. Examples of professions that have their own set of professional ethics include law, medicine, engineering, accounting, and journalism.
</li>
              <li type="none">&#10148;  &nbsp;&nbsp;
Understanding and adhering to professional ethics is crucial for professionals to maintain their reputation and credibility. Failure to uphold ethical standards can lead to legal and professional consequences, as well as damage to the profession as a whole. Therefore, it is important for professionals to be knowledgeable about their ethical obligations and to integrate ethical principles into their everyday practice.</li>
